This module is a quick and easy way to use your tracks with Views and Openlayers.
It presents a WKT Linestring in a field that you can use in an Openlayers Data Layer.
This is all it does. No more thought has gone into it than that, really just a proof of concept at this stage.
I intend to provide a WKT Formatter for the base Trackfield as well in this module.
This will allow the field to take its place if the raw data is required in the same view.
