Gmap README

The Drupal 7 Gmap Module is still in development and not stable enough for use on a production site.
This port of Track Map which I have rechristened Track GMap has all the inner workings of Track but not a stable
Gmap module to partner with. So it will have to lie in wait.
The rendering of the map in the node is unsightly at present. This true in Bartik. Applying CSS fixes this of course.
I will raise an issue in the GMap queue and have a look at Gmap CSS for a potential patch.

Currently apply specified height and width to .gmap_gmap will render the map in a useful way.
